SELLER Notes for this *Nissan Rogue*: This  2014 Nissan Rogue doesn't compromise function for style. This Rogue has traveled 14834 miles, and is ready for you to drive it for many more. It checks off in-demand features such as: heated seats,power seats,rear view camera,navigation,power windows,power locks,blue tooth,mp3 audio input and leather seats   Listen to what one customer said,Did a lot of research and picked the Rogue in Midnight Jade. Surprised every 3rd car on the road isnt 1. Ive found 4 distinct driving modes. The put it in drive and go mode, the Low mode- for slow, bad conditions driving, sport mode-yahoo. when I get it broke in Ill b using almost exclusively. Last is turning off the OD or over-drive. Great for going up hills. I dont have to worry about mph, live close to work, so when the motor is broke in...sport mode! The active trace- inside wheels brake slightly is nice. But the birdseye-view camera is awesome, better than I thought. I feel if I didnt get a lemon, ill be raving about this car for years......update.... It's been over 18 months now and I love it just as much as I did when I bought it. Goes to show, do your research. If the Rogue had an extra 100HP, this would be the perfect vehicle.

Nisan Rogue SUV/ All Wheel Drive (Good for winter season)
Price asking; $3900
151,000 millage on it.
Ice cold A/C 
1 month before change new breaks
1 month before change wheel bearing
3 month before change All 4 new Shocks
Its a 4 cylinder car and its great on gas. Runs great and have a good condition, you wouldn't need to go to repair shop in near future years because I did recently all major/minor fixing that normally required a old car such as new breaks change, oil/air filter change, wheel bearing change, new shocks change, lineament, new A/C compressor change and new battery change.

SELLER Notes for this *Nissan Rogue*: Delivering power, style and convenience, this  2013 Nissan Rogue has everything you're looking for. This Rogue has traveled 42258 miles, and is ready for you to drive it for many more. Never be bored with the numerous built-in features, such as: power windows,power locks and mp3 audio input   Listen to what one customer said,We bought the Nissan Rogue for two reasons:  Very high safety and reliability ratings (why buy a car that doesn't have these?) and exceptionally comfortable. seats.  Our other SUV is a Honda CRV, which is a bit bigger, and we needed the size for family trips.  The two cars were equal in safety and reliability, but the CRV had a slight edge in many small convenience areas, which made us willing to live with its excruciatingly uncomfortable seats.  (Really, Honda, get with it on seating.  The Internet agrees that Honda cars have been uncomfortable for ages.)  Anyway, the Rogue has seating like a dream, with proper support for your lower back.  Plus, it includes variable speeds for the intermittent wipers, which the Honda (inexplicably) lacks.  We're on our third tank of gas with this new vehicle, and pushing 30mpg.  To improve this vehicle Nissan could shrink or eliminate the front row console, which leaves you with no where to put a purse, and offer some interior colors other than gray/black, but overall, we love it.  I have very long legs, and there's plenty of leg room. Consumer Review Edmunds.com   We encourage you to experience this Rogue for yourself.  , 2013 *Nissan Rogue* AWD 4dr SL
