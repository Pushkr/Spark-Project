SELLER Notes for this *Toyota RAV4*: With an attractive design and price, this  2011 Toyota RAV4 won't stay on the lot for long! This RAV4 has traveled 35332 miles, and is ready for you to drive it for many more. You'll love this long list of impressive amenities: moon roof,power windows,power locks,blue tooth and mp3 audio input   Listen to what one customer said,I was driving at highway speed when a car ran a stop sign and stopped right in front of me.  The anti-locked brakes worked perfectly, allowing a great reduction in speed before impact.  The collapsible front end did what it was supposed to do.  The air bag deployed with no problem.  Car is totaled but I'm untouched.  I loved the car: it had great pickup, was comfortable and roomy and drove well.  I have replaced it with a 2016 RAV4 Hybrid.

Appointments are recommended due to the fast turnover on models such as this one. Listen to what one customer said, I was having several problems with my 2013 Ford Escape,  needed something reliable. I had always owned Chevrolet and Ford. Decided to give Toyota a shot for reliability. I am very pleased with my purchase. The transmission is smoother than the Escape. Voice commands are much better than the Microsoft Sync System. Interior room is wider and back seat leg room is bigger. For the value,  the XLE comes with sunroof and several other features standard. The APPS button on radio is great,  Weather provided by Weather Channel,  along with traffic. Works in areas with HD FM signals,  I did not opt for the Navigation. MPG much better than Escape.
